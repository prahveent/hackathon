## Security Implementation ✅

### Authentication System
- ✅ **JWT Token-based Authentication**: Secure token generation and validation
- ✅ **Password Security**: BCrypt hashing with salt rounds
- ✅ **Token Expiration**: 24-hour token lifetime with automatic refresh
- ✅ **Secure Headers**: Authorization headers with Bearer token format

### Authorization Framework
- ✅ **Role-based Access Control**: Enum-based user roles (Customer: 0, Administrator: 1)
- ✅ **Route Guards**: AuthGuard and AdminGuard for protecting routes
- ✅ **API Endpoint Security**: Role-based endpoint protection
- ✅ **Frontend Guards**: Preventing unauthorized component access

### Session Management
- ✅ **Persistent Authentication**: LocalStorage-based token persistence
- ✅ **SSR Compatibility**: Platform-aware localStorage access
- ✅ **Automatic Logout**: Token expiration handling
- ✅ **Session State Management**: Reactive authentication state with BehaviorSubject

### Data Protection
- ✅ **CORS Configuration**: Secure cross-origin request handling
- ✅ **Input Validation**: DTO-based request validation
- ✅ **SQL Injection Protection**: Entity Framework parameterized queries
- ✅ **Role-based Data Access**: Users can only access data appropriate to their role

## User Experience Implementation ✅

### Customer Experience
- ✅ **Clean Interface**: Focused dashboard without administrative clutter
- ✅ **Intuitive Navigation**: Feature cards for easy access to main functions
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Modern, mobile-friendly interface

### Separation of Concerns
- ✅ **Role-based Routing**: Completely separate route structures (`/customer/*` vs `/admin/*`)
- ✅ **Component Isolation**: Distinct components for each user type
- ✅ **Access Control**: Automatic redirection for unauthorized access attempts
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Dedicated access denied page for security violations

## Technical Implementation Details ✅

### Backend Architecture (.NET Core)
- ✅ **JWT Service**: Custom JWT token generation and validation
- ✅ **Password Service**: Secure password hashing and verification
- ✅ **Auth Controller**: Registration, login, and token refresh endpoints
- ✅ **User Controller**: CRUD operations with role-based authorization
- ✅ **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core
- ✅ **Migration System**: Automated database schema management

### Frontend Architecture (Angular 19)
- ✅ **Authentication Service**: Centralized auth state management
- ✅ **User Service**: User CRUD operations with proper authorization
- ✅ **Route Guards**: AuthGuard and AdminGuard implementations
- ✅ **HTTP Interceptor**: Automatic token injection for API requests
- ✅ **Reactive State**: Observable-based authentication state
- ✅ **SSR Support**: Platform-aware implementation for server-side rendering

### API Endpoints
```
✅ POST /api/auth/register - User registration
✅ POST /api/auth/login - User authentication
✅ GET /api/users - List all users (Admin only)
✅ GET /api/users/{id} - Get user details
✅ PUT /api/users/{id} - Update user
✅ DELETE /api/users/{id} - Delete user (Admin only)
✅ PUT /api/users/{id}/status - Toggle user status (Admin only)
```

### Frontend Routes
```
✅ / → /login (redirect)
✅ /login - Login component
✅ /register - Registration component
✅ /customer/dashboard - Customer dashboard (AuthGuard)
✅ /admin/dashboard - Admin dashboard (AdminGuard)
✅ /admin/users - User management (AdminGuard)
✅ /access-denied - Unauthorized access page
```
