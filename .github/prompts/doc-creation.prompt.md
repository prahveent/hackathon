 # Doc Generation Prompt

 Analyze the provided code samples and update the existing Markdown documentation accordingly. If no documentation exists, generate a new one. When updating, ensure that the documentation remains concise, relevant, and structured for ease of understanding.

 - Identify and incorporate patterns from similar code samples to make the documentation more comprehensive and reusable.
 - Ensure the documentation is generic enough to support future code generation while maintaining clarity and accuracy.
 - Strictly document only the requested scopeâ€”avoid adding unrelated or unnecessary details.
 - You may add examples, however do not replicate content in docs where you are able to refer to the file location in the docs.
 - Document reference file locations as needed in the docs.

 Always update `docs/index.md` with the document file if it is not existing in the index.
